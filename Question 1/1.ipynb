    "Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves identifying named entities within a text and classifying them into predefined categories such as names of persons, organizations, locations, dates, quantities, monetary values, and more. NER is crucial for various NLP applications such as information extraction, question answering, and sentiment analysis.\n"
